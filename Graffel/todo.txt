* testRange()
  - create weighted and relative values.
    > a weighed range needs a absolute begin and endpoint
    > weights only have meaning in combination with markers.
    > test case:
      1#begin..#middle..10#end
      > for a slice, a begin or endpoint can have a marker attached to it.
      > just a string will do.
      > in above example, the weights are implicit, but the generated slices will have explicit values.
        > when creating the range, the slices get determined.
  - create a marker: just a string?
  - create ranges as lists of slices and markers.
    > or...a timeline is a list of ranges and markers?
    > no, better allow markers in ranges, otherwise we would need time-slices.


* timer speed
  > since a timer.tick() function may be called slower than the expected ticks, a timer should not assume being called for every tick.
  > this means, that timer.tick() should return true even if a number of ticks have been missed.
  > this also means that a timer should not assume all ticks were encountered/registered.
    > in the most extreme case, a loop timer may already have looped a couple of times before the nect tick() call.

* state
  > block state?
  > timeline state?

* draw()
  - a timeline only has ONE block, to avoid confusion in the example below.
  > who draws? Timeline or Block?
  - a block HAS a timeline.
  - can a sub-timeline be faster than master?
    - YES! otherwise too restrictive.
    - NO! otherwise, no option to slow down full animation.
    > make distinction between time and ticks.
      > time has hightest and undetermined resolution.
      > tick has parent's resolution.


//////////EXAMPLE CODE /////////////////


master_timeline
  { //base block
    { //sub block one, inherits timeline if none specified
    
    } //no comma - this would be annoying when copying/moving blocks.
    { //sub block two, same timeline.
    
    }
    another_timeline //could be a faster timeline.
    {
    }
    { //which timeline? master or another_timeline?
      
      // block inherits master_timeline!
    }
    copyof timeline_var //a copy of a timeline
    {
    }
  }

* draw()
  - as frequent as possible (avoid this: have a separate draw() function that ignores the timeline ticks: continuousDraw(), forcedDraw(), drawNow(),...)
    - the default timeline.Tick always returns true and thus draws continuously.
  - or at fixed intervals
  - or at calculated intervals (speed up?)
  - or at markers only.
* add masterTimeline as param to draw()
  > easy access to:
    - absolute time since start of THIS timeline.
    - pointer to timeline of *this* block
    - active markers.
* timelines can be defined before a block or assigned to a variable that is used before a block, to be able to separate complex timelines definitions from block definitions
* markers
  - remain ON until next marker.
  - have a 'reported' flag when the main loop informed the listeners (?) the flag was set, to avoid reporting it multiple times.

* how to show a constant speed, independent of FPS or tick-speed?
 - a 60 FPS tick and a 30FPS tick should show a movement at the same speed.

Language definition
----------------------

 operators:
 n..m  ; move from n to m
 ~n..m~ : soft start and soft end
 n.fn.m ; move from n to m using fn as a function
 -> = fn ; set default move function
 n->+m ; move n to m+n

 positions;
 n ; a number is an absolute position
 +n or -n ; relative position to parent.

 * All graphics live in a timeline - linear or loop
   - loop can be implicit or explicit duration
     - implicit requires inner timelines to determine outer duration.

* allow block comments:
  /{  --> comments out the whole block
  .....
   }


    Build compiler
---------------
- tokenize
- build tree (syntax analysis)
- verify tree (semantic analysis)
- create code (see three address code or 3AC, for semi asm code)


SKIA
------
* Split SDL and Skia code.
* Check out sk_app/main_win.
  > remove SDL code?
