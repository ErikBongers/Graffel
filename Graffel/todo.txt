Needed for iDea
----------------
* text editor. : skia/modules/skplaintexteditor
* animations for transitions.


* Adorners?
* Styles for nodes? (set of preferences, like fixed size, set of colors,...)

iDea v2
------------
- Goal is combine Word with Whiteboard
- no OneNote !!!!! Too loose.
- more like Whiteboard, but with more functionality.
- also a bit like Word.
-Nodes
  - all nodes have 3 levels: thumb, post-it and full
  > text
    - a title for thumb 
    - small note for post it
    - full text (or subcanvas for detailed view)
  > image
  > subCanvas

- Lists and hierarchies.
  > different auto-sorts
    > but can be broken
      > bit like windows desktop - layout of icons.
      > items can be selected and grouped.
  > group boundaries not necessarily constantly visible.
  > multiple lists of same items ("create duplicate group")
- view a group as a document (like Word)
  > continuous view
  > page view

- Layouts
  > for lists, linear, tiled, all in differnt directions.
  > for trees?
    > every subtree is a group and can thus be copied to diffent layouts.

Image:. A read-only source of pixels.  May refer to encoded data.
Surface: A destination for drawing, either CPU or GPU.
Canvas: the abstract drawing interface.  Can point at a Surface, a Picture recorder, or Document.
Picture: a sequence of drawing commands; i.e. a command buffer
(Bitmap: before Surface and Image, was a source and a destination for drawing. Image/Source allows for more optimizationa.)
